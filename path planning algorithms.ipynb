If the sampled point has no collisions, it is then checked if the straight line path between the sampled point and the nearest existing point in the tree has any collisions. If this straight line path has no collisions, the sampled point is added to the tree with the nearest point as its parent node. If there is a collision, this point is thrown out.\n",

    "Breadth-first search is a way to find all the vertices reachable from the a given source vertex, s. Like depth first search, BFS traverse a connected component of a given graph and defines a spanning tree. Intuitively, the basic idea of the breath-first search is this: send a wave out from source s. The wave hits all vertices 1 edge from s. From there, the wave hits all vertices 2 edges from s. Etc. We use FIFO queue Q to maintain the wavefront: v is in Q if and only if wave has hit v but has not come out of v yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Breadth-first search starts at a given vertex s, which is at level 0. In the first stage, we visit all the vertices that are at the distance of one edge away. When we visit there, we paint as \"visited,\" the vertices adjacent to the start vertex s - these vertices are placed into level 1. In the second stage, we visit all the new vertices we can reach at the distance of two edges away from the source vertex s. These new vertices, which are adjacent to level 1 vertices and not previously assigned to a level, are placed into level 2, and so on. The BFS traversal terminates when every vertex has been visited.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**BFS** works by expanding the start node and adding its successors into the $\\texttt{fringe}$, and then the successors of the start node are similarly expanded, and so on. In other words, all nodes at a given depth in the search tree are expanded before moving on to the next. This process is repeated until either the goal is found or all possible nodes have been expanded.\n",
    "\n",
    "BFS is complete in the sense that the algorithm will always find the goal if it exists. The path from start to goal is also always optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since BFS probes through the entire search space at each level in the search tree, it has very large time and space-complexity. The problem worsens  if the goal node is many steps away from the start. Therefore, BFS is not a suitable strategy when a large search space is involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DFS** works a little bit differently than BFS. It always expands the deepest node in the $\\texttt{fringe}$ of the search tree. This process is repeated until either the goal is found or all possible nodes have been expanded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like BFS, DFS is also complete, but only because the depth is bounded by the size of the search grid. However, the path found is not always optimal depending on where the goal is located on the search grid.  In general, it is accepted that DFS is not optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS has a low space-complexity since it only expands one node at a time on each level on the search tree. When that node's descendants have been fully explored, it can be safely deleted from memory. Its time-complexity may differ, however, again depending on where the goal is located on search grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**$A^*$** search is both complete and optimal only if the heuristic $h(x)$ is admissible. Admissible heuristics are optimistic -- the value is always less than or equal to the true cost. In this case, $h(x)$ is derived from a relaxed version of the grid, i.e. grids with no forbidden nodes. The $h(x)$ value is then done by simply calculating the differences between the coordinates of the node and the goal node. This formula proves to be admissible because it never overestimates the cost to goal node and is actually equal to the true cost in a relaxed grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**$A^*$ ** search has very high time and space-complexity. $A^*$ stores all nodes in memory. Its time-complexity is greatly affected by the relative error in $h(x)$ and by the length of solution. However, in a small workspace with good $h(x)$ and $g(x)$ evaluation fuctions, $A^*$ search works very well.\n",
